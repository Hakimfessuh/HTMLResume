    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> As an ambitious Computer Science major at Hagerstown Community College, my passion and curiosity have led me down the exciting path of software development. 
        Over the past six months, I have immersed myself in the real-world applications of my academic studies as a Software Developer Intern. 
        I thrive on challenges and quickly adapt to new environments, where I can apply my knowledge and technical skills to add value to projects.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm proud to be an active member of the Black Student Union, where I strive to make a difference in my community. 
        My goal is to leverage technology to create solutions that have meaningful societal impact. Whether the task is large or small, I am eager to learn, grow, and make a difference. 
        As I prepare to transition from academia to professional life, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can blend my passion for software development with my desire to contribute positively to society.</p>
